# 1.1 Think About Time

1.1 Think About Time (medium)

Reflection:

The way in which you develop habits will slowly change the way you feel and appear to others. While individual habits aren’t usually attributed to you self image, the cumulative net effect has a profound impact. This conjecture was very interesting to me. By slowly building up on habits one at a time, you grow in the practice of developing and tackling different habits. Essentially once you have mastered how to create a single habit, you can apply this ad infinitum. In addition, I learned about the power of developing habits in small increments, and anchoring them onto pre-existing behaviors. This is a crucial aspect of the practice of creating a habit. To me, it is hard to find the right time to start doing something: setting apart time, feeling motivated, trying to get up and do it. Thus, by associating to existing habits, you build upon that core “muscle” of doing something over and over again.

Time Boxing is an important part of building a habit, as it has to do with being honest with your-self. You set a period of time that you will work and stay focused on a task at hand, once that time is finished you can reflect on how close you were to completing that task. This allows you to tackle goals incrementally, rather than working non-stop until you finish a given goal. Also, time-boxing invariably provides mental breaks.  To me, time boxing is the practical application of developing a habit.

I manage my time currently by writing a list of tasks, essentially a to-do list. I rate them in importance, and in difficulty. To prevent myself from getting overwhelmed, I will try and do one or two tasks right when I wake up. Usually chores or errands that don’t require a lot of brain power of reflection. Getting that initial task complete sets my day up for tackling the next task. For me I thrive on momentum, so once a task is completed, I try and keep that energy to approach the next task. The second I feel tired or stressed, I take a break: watch a show, browse the web, take a nap, etc. This strategy works for me now with an unstructured day, I have created my own pattern/rhythm of working and resting until I get to bed.

I feel that I can implement trying new habits, with the anchoring method and incremental approach detailed above.

My approach for Phase 0 is to try out meditation as a way to handle stress I may encounter in the future, and to practice coding daily and often in short bursts until I have built up a habit (i.e. the Pomodoro technique). I feel I will be also trying to time box my tasks into one hour increments (essentially the length of  single class/lecture) and seeing how much I get done and tracking that process.

# 1.2 The Command Line

1.2 Command Line

Shell and Bash scripting are often times interchangeable, but effectively bash is an implementation of shell. Shell is the unix command line interpreter while bash is a type of shell most commonly found in Mac OS X.

I was able to go through the exercise, the most challenging was grasping the concept of popd and pushd. It finally made sense when understanding that you were essentially manipulating the original file path that was created.

I was able to successfully follow the steps and practice each command.

The most important commands would be: “cd” to navigate the file paths, “ls” to be able to see what directories exist, and the creation and deletion of files and directories with “mkdir”, “rmdir”, and “touch”.

Pwd = print working directory
Ls = list directory
Mv = move
Cd = change directory
../ = go up a level
touch = create new file
mkdir = make new directory
less = page through a file
rmdir = remove directory
rm = remove
help = help menu and tips
