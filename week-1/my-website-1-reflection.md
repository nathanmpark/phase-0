## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup Reflection

- Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
- Describe what open source means.
- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
- Assess the importance of using licenses.
- What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Creating a repository in Github is straightfoward. Simpy click the "+" sign at the top right corner of the screen and select create new repository. Provide a desired name, choose the public/privacy setting, and select a license. Once the repository is established, when viewing the page on Github, there should be a Github link on the right side bar. Copy the link and write "git clone [Github Link]" into the terminal.

Open Source means having code open and free to share and view in the public. Often times a company will provide open source software to reap the benefits of individual developers testing, using, and modifying the original code base.

Open Source seems to be the wave of the future, but the current business model of subscription based software will take a while to change. Open source provides users with an immense amount of power at their fingertips, and if anything does the best job at advertising a company's product. If everything is free, it leaves to question how these businesses make money. Often times a "Pay for more" business model comes into play or advertising showing up in different places. As it hasn't become main stream, it has yet to be seen what major impacts open source may have.

The importance of using licenses comes into relevance when creating or publishing code publically. It sets the limitations on specific permissions for others to use your work. Open soure licenses make it easier for people to contribute to your work without having to see special permissions.

Having to repeat the adding, committing, branching, and merging made the learning a lot more hands on and solidified the practice more than anything I've tried to learn online independently. One of my "aha" moments that I struggled with was in realizing you have to go directly to github.com to accept pull requests. However, there are independent open source github gems that can allow you to do it through command line.

I am personally trying out the hub command line tool with the alias of git so I get all functionality with the same syntax, as opposed to installing the github gem.
