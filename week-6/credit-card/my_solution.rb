# Class Warfare, Validate a Credit Card Number


# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: David O'Keefe].
# I spent [2] hours on this challenge.

# Pseudocode

# Input: 4 sets of 4 numbers, 16 numbers in total
# Output: true or false based on if the credit card number is valid
# Steps:

# Check that the input is 16 numbers long
# put the numbers into an array

# Starting with the second to last digit, double every other digit until you reach the first digit.
# reverse the array
# create a counter for index position, increment by 2
# split array based on index (even + 0) and (odd)
# (even + 0) array items should be doubled

# Sum all the untouched digits and the doubled digits (doubled digits need to be broken apart, 10 becomes 1 + 0).
# sum all the (odd) array items
# array items in the "tens" need to be broken up

# If the total is a multiple of ten, you have received a valid credit card number!
# sum the total of both arrays (even + 0) and (odd)
# return true if multiple of ten
# else return false

# Initial Solution

# Don't forget to check on initialization for a card length
# of exactly 16 digits

# class CreditCard
#   attr_accessor :even_index_numbers, :odd_index_numbers, :answer
#   attr_reader :card_number

#   def initialize(card_number)
#     card_number = card_number.to_s.split("")
#     if card_number.length == 16
#       @card_number = card_number
#     else
#       raise ArgumentError
#     end
#     @even_index_numbers = []
#     @odd_index_numbers = []
#     @answer = 0
#   end

#   def check_card
#     split_card_number
#     double_digits
#     split_digits
#     add_numbers
#     @answer % 10 == 0
#   end

#   def split_card_number
#     index = 0
#     length = card_number.length
#     until index == length
#       if index.even?
#         @even_index_numbers << card_number[index]
#       else
#         @odd_index_numbers << card_number[index]
#       end
#         index += 1
#     end
#   end

#   def double_digits
#     even_index_numbers.map! {|num| num.to_i * 2 }
#   end

#   def split_digits
#     @even_index_numbers = even_index_numbers.join("").split("")
#   end

#   def add_numbers
#     @even_index_numbers.each {|num| @answer += num.to_i}
#     @odd_index_numbers.each {|num| @answer += num.to_i}
#   end

# end

# Reflection

# What was the most difficult part of this challenge for you and your pair?
# We worked for about 2 hours on this challenge, I think the hardest part was catching every instance variable, which should have been prefixed with the @ symbol.

# What new methods did you find to help you when you refactored?
# I dont think there were any new methods that were used, but as always enumerables came in handy.

# What concepts or learnings were you able to solidify in this challenge?
# Able to solidify the use of instance variables and how they can be used to communicate across the different methods.
