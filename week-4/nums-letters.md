>What does puts do?

Puts returns nil and prints the output to the console with a new line

>What is an integer? What is a float?

Integers are numbers without decimal points. Float is short for floating-point-numbers or numbers with decimal points.

>What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Float and integer division is math with and without the decimal, respectively. When dividing with integers, you can only result in integer values (which are rounded down). For example, when counting how many 2-dollar movie tickets you could buy with $9. You would result in 4 movie tickets, instead of 4.5 tickets (movie theaters would not sell half-tickets).

```ruby
# Hours in a year
puts 24*365

# Minutes in a decade
puts 60*24*365*10
```

>How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

Ruby breaks down the [basic math](basic-math.rb) to its simplest form. Multiplication of 2 * 3 is simply 2 + 2 + 2. Ruby acts as a calculator and will determine the final output based on it being intergers or floats that were input.

>What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

[Strings](simple-string.rb) are values made up or characters(letters or numbers), spaces, or special characters. Strings can be assigned to account for names, or values which you want to preserve the exact content.

>What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

Local [variables](defining-variables.rb) are stored in the computers memory to be re-used as many times as needed. You may use a variable when you know the set value of a string or integer that is not subject to change. For example, the set name of a user within a system may not change and can be set to a variable.

>How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

This was a refreshing challenge to get back to the basics. Also it is great to read about code in addition to practicing it or watching videos.
