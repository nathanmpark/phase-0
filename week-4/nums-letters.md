>What is an integer? What is a float?

Integers are numbers without decimal points. Float is short for floating-point-numbers or numbers with decimal points.

>What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Float and integer division is math with and without the decimal, respectively. When dividing with integers, you can only result in integer values (which are rounded down). For example, when counting how many 2-dollar movie tickets you could buy with $9. You would result in 4 movie tickets, instead of 4.5 tickets (movie theaters would not sell half-tickets).
