<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

Berkshire Hathaway as a site was a great example to work through. It was a lot of repetition in using the unordered lists but overall working through the code and checking back to the page was a great way to validate my learning. In addition, I was able to get the fundamentals down from watching the html videos and doing some code academy.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

Finding results online for HTML5 elements were abundant and not that hard to find overall. There seems to be plentiful resources online for formatting and using HTML5.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

I am a stickler for trying to follow good formatting. What I found was that Sublime does a good job a general indentation. Not sure yet exactly is good form for how man indents go in, or how often, but the structure of the language and my coding seems to flow and is easy to read.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

Good: Fun to learn, easy to understand, and generally a very structured language.

Bad: Can become repetitive in adding content to the page, has specific tags for each thing, which will require rote memorization to recall at a moments notice.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

Dont know if there are any tricks, but the auto populate function on Sublime seems to help, and researching tags and how they are formatted are the most useful to me. Otherwise, practice makes perfect.
