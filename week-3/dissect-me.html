        Version Control is an important part of software development. Anytime a group of programmers may be working on a code base, it is subject to being changed by multiple individuals. Version control acts as a way of tracking historical changes to an original copy of code, and allows you to go back to any previous versions. Git is a type of open source version control, and Github is a website that acts as a tool to using git.

      My first week has been very enjoyable. I am already learning a ton of new information. This week I was introduced to Git and Github. Git uses a version control system and you download it to your computer. Github is a open source online community that you can post your files to and have other people look at them and edit them. Version Control is another cool thing I learned about this week. Essentially what it is is just a great way to keep track of your progress with the use of different saved commits. These commits are like "screenshots" of your work and you are able to navigate back and forth through the commits. This is extremly helpful for fixing bugs in your code which can be hard to identify at times. Being able to work back and forth through the commits makes it eaiser to identify where your code took a turn for the worst. You can then start from that commit and just build off the previous code that you have entered.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

There is the basic skeleton tags that have been used for every html file (doctype, head, title, body, html, etc.) This has been streamlined with the new snippet created.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Elements get laid out onto the page based on the tags used. The browser will go through and parse the parent tags first before delving deeper into each child tag.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I have learned about to extensive amount of shortcuts and now snippets available in sublime to automate repetitive tasks. Snippets will definitely be a great way to save skeleton code or repeaded frames of code in a future date. Now that we have begun seriously using sublime, there will be many more shortcuts to discover and learn from other students.
