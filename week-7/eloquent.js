// Introduction:

// Did you learn anything new about JavaScript or programming in general?
// It was nice to learn about the history of JavaScript and especially the strange nature of how it go it's name. Also, about the flexible nature of the language.

// Are there any concepts you feel uncomfortable with?
// I am curious to learn about the syntatical differences between JavaScript and Ruby.


// Chp. 1:Values, Types,and Operators

// Identify two similarities and two differences between JavaScript and Ruby syntax with regard to numbers, arithmetic, strings, booleans, and various operators.
// JavaScript and Ruby share many common functionalities, such as the way number, strings, and booleans are treated with their respective operators and comparisons ( +,-,/,==,<,etc.). In addition, they both have th  "\" for escaping characters.
// Two differences exist in the way they handle undefined values and automatic type conversion. While Ruby uses nil as its main undefined value, JavaScript has null and undefined. In addition, while Ruby does not have any kind of automatic type conversion, JavaScript will try and convert number and strings based on internal conversion rules, making it easy to run almost any kind fo code.


// Chp. 2:Program Structure

// What is an expression?
// A fragment of code that produces a value.

// What is the purpose of semicolons in JavaScript? Are they always required?
// Semicolons are used to end a statement. Expressions followed by a semicolon signal JavaScript when to move onto the next statement. Semicolons are not always required, but it is good practice to end statements as such. By leaving them out, you can cause confusion when the program is parsing the syntax.

// What causes a variable to return undefined?


// What does console.log do and when would you use it? What Ruby method(s) is this similar to?
// Describe while and for loops
// What other similarities or differences between Ruby and JavaScript did you notice in this section?






// Reflections:

// What are the biggest similarities and differences between JavaScript and Ruby?
// Was some of your Ruby knowledge solidified by learning another language? If so, which concepts?
// How do you feel about diving into JavaScript after reading these chapters?
